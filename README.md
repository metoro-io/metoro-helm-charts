# Metoro Helm Charts

This repository contains the Helm Charts for Metoro.

## Metoro Exporter

Metoro exporter is a collection of components that collects traces, logs, metrics and profiling data from a Kubernetes
cluster and exports them back to metoro.

### Interesting values

All of the values can be seen in the `values.yaml` file. However it is quite large so here are some of the more
interesting values.
